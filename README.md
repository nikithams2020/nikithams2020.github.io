## Work Experience
**Research Data Scientist @ Research and CyberInfrastructure SDSU (_Jan 2024 - Present_)**
- Developed real-time Grafana dashboards, metrics to track 100,000+ CPU, GPU, and storage usage across 23 CSU campuses, providing
actionable insights that enhanced resource allocation efficiency by 40%.
- Engineered and maintained containerized software ecosystems, Kubernetes infrastructure for Machine Learning and GenAI projects,
supporting over 1,50,000+ compute hours monthly for $991,749 NSF-funded TIDE projects at SDSU.
- Architected, deployed high-performance code for Large Language Models (LLM) and Generative AI in Kubernetes-based
environments, reducing model training time by 30%.
- Analyzed Qualtrics survey data to manage over 1,000 hours of service and consultation. Also handled, delivered tailored solutions via
ServiceNow Portal.

**Product Analyst Manager @ Omnificence (_Feb 2022 - Aug 2022_)**  
- Implemented machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost) for churn pattern recognition, achieving 85% accuracy in
identifying at-risk customers.
- Developed Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline using NLTK and SpaCy for sentiment analysis on customer feedback,
extracting key attrition factors with 90%.
- Engineered interactive Tableau dashboards with custom SQL queries, visualizing churn KPIs and predictive model outputs, driving a
55% improvement in customer retention strategies.

**Data Analyst @ CogAI (_Apr 2021 - Feb 2022_)**  
- Analyzed customer pain points and key patterns in the utilities sector using t SNE, identifying 10 high-impact parameters for power
outage prediction and deriving relevant KPIs.
- Trained SVM Regressor model to predict power outages, achieving 85% accuracy, 0.9 recall, and 0.86 F1 score, resulting in 25%
revenue increase and 30% reduction in false alarms.
- Crafted strategic product Roadmaps, devised data-driven solutions that increased overall efficiency by 15%, leveraging advanced
analytics techniques to optimize utility operations and customer service delivery.
- Leveraged ArcGIS to design and implement region-specific dashboards, enabling efficient monitoring of power outages and critical
infrastructure challenges across multiple geographical areas
